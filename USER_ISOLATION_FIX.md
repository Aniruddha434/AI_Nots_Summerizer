# User Isolation Fix - History Data Leakage

## Problem Description

The application was showing history data to every account, even when that history didn't belong to them. This was a critical security issue where:

1. **Cross-user data exposure**: Users could see summaries and transcripts created by other users
2. **No access control**: The API endpoints didn't filter data by user ownership
3. **Anonymous data mixing**: Anonymous users could see authenticated user data and vice versa

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in the API endpoints that retrieve lists of summaries and transcripts:

### Before Fix:
```javascript
// GET /api/summaries - This returned ALL summaries from ALL users
const query = { isActive: true };
// No user filtering - major security flaw!

// GET /api/transcripts - This returned ALL transcripts from ALL users  
const query = { isActive: true };
// No user filtering - major security flaw!
```

### The Problem:
- No user-based filtering in list endpoints
- No authorization checks in individual resource endpoints
- Mixed data between authenticated and anonymous users

## Solution Implemented

### 1. User-Based Data Filtering

**Summaries Route (`/api/summaries`)**:
```javascript
const query = { isActive: true };

// Filter by current user - this ensures data isolation
if (req.user) {
  // Authenticated user - show only their summaries
  query.createdBy = req.user.id;
} else {
  // Anonymous user - show only anonymous summaries
  query.createdBy = 'anonymous';
}
```

**Transcripts Route (`/api/transcripts`)**:
```javascript
const query = { isActive: true };

// Filter by current user - this ensures data isolation
if (req.user) {
  // Authenticated user - show only their transcripts
  query.uploaderId = req.user.id;
} else {
  // Anonymous user - show only anonymous transcripts
  query.uploaderId = 'anonymous';
}
```

### 2. Authorization Checks for Individual Resources

Added ownership verification to all individual resource endpoints:

**Summary Access Control**:
```javascript
// Check if user has access to this summary
const currentUserId = req.user ? req.user.id : 'anonymous';
if (summary.createdBy !== currentUserId) {
  return res.status(403).json({
    error: 'Access denied',
    message: 'You do not have permission to access this summary'
  });
}
```

**Transcript Access Control**:
```javascript
// Check if user has access to this transcript
const currentUserId = req.user ? req.user.id : 'anonymous';
if (transcript.uploaderId !== currentUserId) {
  return res.status(403).json({
    error: 'Access denied',
    message: 'You do not have permission to access this transcript'
  });
}
```

### 3. Sharing Route Protection

**Share Functionality**:
```javascript
// Check if user has access to this summary before sharing
const currentUserId = req.user ? req.user.id : 'anonymous';
if (summary.createdBy !== currentUserId) {
  return res.status(403).json({
    error: 'Access denied',
    message: 'You do not have permission to share this summary'
  });
}
```

## Files Modified

### Backend Routes:
1. **`backend/routes/summaries.js`**:
   - ✅ GET `/api/summaries` - Added user filtering
   - ✅ GET `/api/summaries/:id` - Added ownership check
   - ✅ PUT `/api/summaries/:id` - Added ownership check
   - ✅ DELETE `/api/summaries/:id` - Added ownership check
   - ✅ GET `/api/summaries/:id/versions` - Added ownership check

2. **`backend/routes/transcripts.js`**:
   - ✅ GET `/api/transcripts` - Added user filtering
   - ✅ GET `/api/transcripts/:id` - Added ownership check
   - ✅ DELETE `/api/transcripts/:id` - Added ownership check

3. **`backend/routes/share.js`**:
   - ✅ POST `/api/share` - Added ownership check
   - ✅ GET `/api/share/history/:summaryId` - Added ownership check

## Security Benefits

### ✅ Data Isolation
- Users can only see their own summaries and transcripts
- Anonymous users are properly isolated from authenticated users
- No cross-contamination of data between different user accounts

### ✅ Access Control
- All CRUD operations now verify ownership
- 403 Forbidden responses for unauthorized access attempts
- Proper error messages without information leakage

### ✅ Audit Trail
- Enhanced logging includes user identification
- Better tracking of who accesses what data
- Improved debugging and monitoring capabilities

## Testing

A comprehensive test script was created (`backend/test-user-isolation.js`) that verifies:

1. **User Isolation**: Each user only sees their own data
2. **Cross-User Access Prevention**: Users cannot access other users' data
3. **Anonymous Isolation**: Anonymous users are properly separated
4. **API Security**: All endpoints properly enforce authorization

### Running the Test:
```bash
cd backend
node test-user-isolation.js
```

## Impact

### Before Fix:
- ❌ Users could see ALL summaries from ALL accounts
- ❌ Major privacy and security vulnerability
- ❌ Data leakage between users
- ❌ No access control

### After Fix:
- ✅ Users only see their own data
- ✅ Proper data isolation and privacy
- ✅ Secure access control on all endpoints
- ✅ Anonymous users properly handled
- ✅ 403 Forbidden for unauthorized access

## Backward Compatibility

The fix maintains backward compatibility:
- Existing anonymous data remains accessible to anonymous users
- Existing user data remains accessible to the respective users
- No data migration required
- Frontend code continues to work without changes

## Conclusion

This fix resolves the critical security vulnerability where users could see history data from other accounts. The implementation ensures proper data isolation while maintaining the application's functionality and user experience.
