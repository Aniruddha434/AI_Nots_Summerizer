## How I Built This Project - Step by Step

This section documents my journey building this AI-powered application from scratch as part of my MongoDesk internship assignment.

### üéØ Phase 1: Planning and Architecture (Day 1-2)

**The Challenge**: Create a full-stack application that can intelligently summarize meeting notes using AI.

**My Approach**: I started by sketching out the user flow and deciding on the architecture. I wanted to build something scalable and modern, so I chose:

- **Frontend**: React with Vite for fast development and modern tooling
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express for the API
- **Database**: MongoDB for flexible document storage
- **AI**: Google's Gemini API for intelligent summarization

I spent time researching the best practices for each technology and planning how they would work together.

### üèóÔ∏è Phase 2: Backend Foundation (Day 3-5)

**Setting up the Server**: I began with the backend because I wanted to establish the data flow first. I created:

1. **Basic Express Server**: Set up routing, middleware, and error handling
2. **Database Models**: Designed schemas for Users, Transcripts, and Summaries using Mongoose
3. **Authentication System**: Implemented JWT-based auth with proper password hashing
4. **File Upload**: Added multer middleware for handling transcript file uploads

**Key Learning**: I initially used disk storage for file uploads, but later learned this doesn't work well with cloud deployments. I had to refactor to use memory storage.

### ü§ñ Phase 3: AI Integration (Day 6-7)

**Connecting to Gemini AI**: This was the most exciting part! I integrated Google's Gemini API to generate intelligent summaries.

**Challenges I Faced**:

- Understanding the API documentation and request format
- Handling rate limits and error responses
- Crafting effective prompts to get quality summaries
- Managing API costs during development

**Solution**: I created a dedicated AI service module that handles all Gemini interactions, with proper error handling and retry logic.

### üé® Phase 4: Frontend Development (Day 8-12)

**Building the User Interface**: I focused on creating an intuitive, modern interface:

1. **Component Architecture**: Built reusable components for upload, summary display, and editing
2. **State Management**: Used React Context for global state (auth, transcripts, summaries)
3. **Styling**: Implemented Tailwind CSS for rapid, responsive design
4. **User Experience**: Added loading states, error handling, and success feedback

**Design Philosophy**: I wanted the app to feel professional yet approachable, so I used a clean design with subtle animations and clear visual hierarchy.

### üîê Phase 5: Authentication & Security (Day 13-14)

**User Management**: Implemented a complete authentication system:

- User registration and login
- JWT token management
- Protected routes and API endpoints
- Data isolation (users only see their own data)

**Security Measures**: Added rate limiting, input validation, and CORS configuration.

### üìß Phase 6: Email Integration (Day 15-16)

**Sharing Feature**: Built email functionality so users can share summaries:

- Integrated Nodemailer for email sending
- Created email templates with proper formatting
- Added sharing history and status tracking

**Personal Touch**: I chose to use standard SMTP instead of SendGrid to keep costs low and maintain flexibility.

### üöÄ Phase 7: Deployment Challenges (Day 17-20)

**Going Live**: This was where I learned the most about production deployments:

**Frontend Deployment (Vercel)**:

- Connected GitHub repository
- Configured environment variables
- Set up automatic deployments

**Backend Deployment (Render)**:

- Initially struggled with file upload issues (disk storage problem)
- Learned about ephemeral filesystems in cloud environments
- Refactored to use memory storage for better cloud compatibility

**Database (MongoDB Atlas)**:

- Set up cloud database cluster
- Configured network access and security

**Major Challenges Solved**:

1. **CORS Issues**: Spent hours debugging why frontend couldn't talk to backend. Solution: Properly configured environment variables with full URLs including protocols.
2. **File Upload Failures**: Files weren't being saved on Render. Solution: Switched from disk storage to memory storage.
3. **Environment Variables**: Learning the difference between build-time and runtime variables in different platforms.

### üîß Phase 8: Testing and Refinement (Day 21-22)

**Quality Assurance**: I built comprehensive tests and refined the user experience:

- Created test scripts for all API endpoints
- Tested user authentication flows
- Verified AI summarization quality
- Ensured responsive design across devices

**Performance Optimization**: Added loading states, optimized API calls, and improved error handling.

### üìö What I Learned

**Technical Skills**:

- Full-stack development with modern JavaScript
- AI API integration and prompt engineering
- Cloud deployment and DevOps practices
- Database design and user authentication

**Problem-Solving**:

- How to debug production deployment issues
- The importance of environment-specific configurations
- Cloud platform differences and limitations

**Professional Development**:

- Project planning and time management

- Environment variables configured in Render dashboard
- Health check endpoint: `/health`
- Root directory: `backend/`

**Database (MongoDB Atlas)**:

- Cloud-hosted MongoDB cluster
