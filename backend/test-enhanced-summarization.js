    Meeting: Weekly Team Standup
    Date: March 15, 2024
    Attendees: Sarah Johnson (PM), Mike Chen (Dev), Lisa Rodriguez (Designer)
    
    Sarah opened the meeting discussing the Q1 project status. The team is 75% complete with the new user dashboard.
    
    Key decisions made:
    - Decided to extend the deadline by one week to March 22nd due to additional testing requirements
    - Agreed to implement the dark mode feature in the next sprint
    - Concluded that we need to hire one additional frontend developer
    
    Action items:
    - Mike: Complete API integration testing by March 18th
    - Lisa: Finalize UI mockups for dark mode by March 20th  
    - Sarah: Post job listing for frontend developer by March 16th
    - Team: Review and approve final designs in Friday meeting
    
    Budget discussion: Additional developer will cost approximately $8,000/month. 
    Current project is 15% over budget but within acceptable range.
    
    Next steps: Schedule client demo for March 25th, prepare presentation materials.
